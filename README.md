Device-to-Device Communication App (Offline Chat via Mesh Network)
This app enables offline communication between devices without using the internet. It combines direct in-range chatting and mesh networking to support out-of-range messaging with enhanced security.

ðŸ”— Key Features:
In-Range Communication:
Devices can directly chat with each other using Bluetooth when they are within range.

Mesh Networking for Out-of-Range Communication:
Messages can be relayed through intermediate devices, allowing users to chat even when they are not in direct range.

Secure Messaging:
Messages are securely routed using device MAC addresses and reach only the intended destination. This enhances privacy and prevents unauthorized access.

Offline First:
No internet connection is required â€” ideal for remote locations or emergency situations.
